# University Examination System - SQL Normalization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the normalization process of an unnormalized academic record table from Kalam University of Technology (KUT). The goal is to eliminate data redundancy and anomalies by systematically applying normalization techniques up to Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).

## Dataset Description
- The source table `ACADEMIC_RECORD` consolidates student, department, course, faculty, and examination data.
- Contains attributes such as StudentID, StudentName, Department details, Course details, Faculty details, Semester, and Grades.

## Tasks
This consists of five core tasks:
1. Identification of Primary and Composite Keys to uniquely identify records.
2. Listing and justification of Functional Dependencies (FDs) in the dataset.
3. Normalization to First Normal Form (1NF): Removal of repeating groups ensuring atomic values.
4. Normalization to Second Normal Form (2NF): Elimination of partial dependencies.
5. Normalization to Third Normal Form (3NF) and BCNF: Removal of transitive dependencies and further refinement.

## Deliverables
- Detailed explanation and justification for each normalization step.
- Presentation of resulting normalized tables with clearly indicated Primary Keys (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK).
- Documentation of Functional Dependencies supporting the normalization decisions.

## Learning Outcomes
- Mastery of database normalization concepts for academic datasets.
- Practical experience in identifying functional dependencies and keys.
- Enhanced ability to design efficient and consistent relational database schemas.

## How to Use
- Review the original unnormalized table and sample data.
- Follow the stepwise normalization and note the schema transformations.
- Use this guide to assist in designing robust academic data models in practice.
